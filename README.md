# TSMC Revenue Forecasting using Time Series Analysis
## Description
This GitHub repository contains the code, datasets, plots, and the final report for the project "TSMC Revenue Forecasting using Time Series Analysis." The project aims to analyze the monthly revenue of Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and compare the forecasting performance of three different time series models: SARIMA, Holt-Winters, and FB Prophet. The evaluation metrics used for model comparison include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE). By selecting the best-performing model based on these metrics, the project provides an accurate revenue forecast for the next quarter.

## Contents
The repository is organized into the following sections:

**Code**: This directory contains the code used for data preprocessing, model training, Cross-Validation, and revenue forecasting. The code is provided as an R script.

**Datasets**: This directory contains the dataset used for the analysis. The monthly revenue data of TSMC is obtained from www.tsmc.com and stored in a structured format. The datasets are in RData and CSV file format.

**Final Report**: This directory contains the final report and plots summarizing the project. The plots include visualizations of the revenue data, model performance evaluation, and forecasted revenue for the next year. These visualizations help in understanding the trends, patterns, and model accuracy. The report provides an overview of the project objectives, methodology, data analysis process, evaluation metrics, results, and conclusion. It also highlights the strengths and limitations of each model and offers insights for future research and application.
